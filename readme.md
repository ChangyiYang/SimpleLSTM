# Pebble Bed Reactor with LSTM

Hi guys, welcome to Pebble Bed Reactor program. In this program, we apply LSTM nets to predict the internal state and other quantities about reactor. The program basically consisted of 5 parts.

## PebbleBedReactor.ipynb

Where the main process and result is written and demonstrated.

## DataPrepocessing.py

Includes the functions for data processing.

## NeuralNets.py

Where different neural network is defined.

## TrainMethod.py

Include different training method like grid search.

## Helper.py

Include some helper function, like the function to visualize the result.
